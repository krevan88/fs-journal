## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
```
We started the week out with pair programming on Monday, we failed to properly document the code and what it was doing.
```
2. What went well this week?
```
I feel like UX went well, but that was basically it.
```
3. What would you do differently?
```
I would try to continue pair programming and working directly together. I spent the whole time trying to figure out how/why things worked which caused us to spend way too much time on certain aspects of the project, and take more time than we probably should have.
