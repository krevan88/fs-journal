# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

This week was a bit of a tough one. While I feel like the end result, while we didn't get it in a passing state for grading, ended up being a good project over all. However we kind of took our own "strengths" into account and focused on those. I personally don't feel as though the first two days were great due to the server building and that I feel like I did the majority of the work, while my partner sat back and just agreed with things that I thought, and let me do all the programming. When we got to the front-end, my partner focused on the styling aspect that they liked and let me do all the functionality of the page itself.
