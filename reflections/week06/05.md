# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?



```This week's biggest struggle was keeping track of how components worked in the VUE models. I struggled for a long time on Friday with how I needed to organize my files, and how I would attempt to even go about getting my thoughts and project data onto the page. Focusing on the MVC of the work prior to the introduction of VUE caused me to get confused and really struggle hard with this most recent checkpoint. ```
