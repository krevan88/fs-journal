## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

`I have enjoyed the daily interactions with staff and fellow students the most in this course. I feel as though the further we've gotten in this course, the harder it's become, and the last two weeks with C# and MySQL have been by far the hardest. I still feel lost in some of the things that we've done this week. That is my biggest concern. I feel as though I have been extremely confused with the topics of C# and MySQL, and tackling the hurdle of the server in this project is going to take the most of my time. Once I finally complete the backend, I feel as though the front end will go much easier. Node and Vue have been my favorite points. Vue was extremely hard when I first started looking at the changes in the MVC pattern, but in the end I feel as though it was easier to figure out than I made it out to be. I still get stuck on little things, and the time limits don't help, but I feel that I would still do well in this field. My biggest hurdle in this class was getting stuck on something and not asking for help as soon as possible. I am a problem solver, which can be good, but when faced with the types of time limits we have been during this class, it's been my weakest point.`
