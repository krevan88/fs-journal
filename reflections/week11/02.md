## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`? `A primary key is the main identifier for a set of data on a table. A foreign key references information on another table. `

2. What is an `Alias`? `Aliasing is when you rename something so that you can clarify what something is, when multiple sets of data are named the same. `

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),

  
)

```
`Given the data above, I don't think that you would be able to join the items, due to two separate tables being named the same thing. `
