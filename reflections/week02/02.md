## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
```
Function Declaration, Function Expression, Arrow Function Expression.

+Declaration definitions are hoisted allowing the function to be used before definition.
+Function definitions are not hoisted, meaning you must define them prior to use.
+Arrow Function Expressions are shorter syntax for Function expressions.

```
2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
```
Parameters are inputs into functions, arguments are what are received after completion of a function.
```
3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
```
Higher Order Functions are functions that accept other functions as parameters or functions that return a function as an argument.
```
