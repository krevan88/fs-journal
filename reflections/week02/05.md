# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I feel like I picked up on the JS principles faster than I did with the HTML and CSS principles. I still struggle with how to implement Justify and Align properties in CSS & Bootstrap. I was surprised with how quick I completed the requirements for the checkpoint.
