## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?`Value, reference, pointer.` `value type if it holds a data value within its own memory space, a reference type doesnâ€™t store its value directly. Instead, it stores the address where the value is being stored, Pointer types do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object`

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript? `bool, byte,char,decimal,double,enum,float,int,long,sbyte,short,struct,uint,ulong,ushort` `There are multiple more types since it's a strict language. `

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types? `References are stored in a specific location, value is stored within the class itself. `
