## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column? `Rows contain the entire list item, columns contain the individual assets such as name of all items. `

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

```
CREATE TABLE characters(
  id INT NOT NULL primary key AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  age VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
) DEFAULT charset utf8 COMMENT '';
```

3. What are the difference between the following statements:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

`DELETE FROM removes items from the table, DROP TABLE will remove the entire table`
