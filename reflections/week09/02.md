2. What benefits do Github actions provide? `Actions provide benefits like allowing content to be pushed to your hosting platform when changes are detected to the main/master branch of your repo, or to test code when pushed to an alternate release branch. `

3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do? `The types of actions listed on the reading are Workflow, Scheduled, Webhooks and External actions. However I do not fully understand the reading and how they are used. `
