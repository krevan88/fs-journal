# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

`This week I learned that you can really break trust with people if you don't take their projects seriously. I was not fully invested in the capstone my initial group was working on, and instead opted to start new on my own project. I then began running into issues with my project's development and realized that it would've been a lot easier to work as a group and invest in their success, rather than back out and try doing something on my own.`
