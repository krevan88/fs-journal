## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide? ```It's a good way to share your experience and abilities, by showing off things you're building or have built. ```

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective? ```A developer portfolio can be effective by showing your knowledge of certain aspects of design or functionality. It's a good way to say "look at what I can do with this language". ```

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why? ```Right now I have Tower which could possibly be a good project for my portfolio once I iron out the last few things that I wasn't able to complete. The other thing I could use right now is PlanIt, again when I finish building out the last few items. ```
