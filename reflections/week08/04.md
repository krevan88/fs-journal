## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide? ```Unit Testing allows you to test individual units of code in isolation. Component Testing allows you to test full components once they're attached to the DOM. End-to-End testing allows you to test all layers of your application, both front-end and back-end. ```

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why? ```I think unit testing is the most important. Testing as you go make sure that the code is working and is consistent the entire way through the process. ```

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why? ```Least useful would maybe be component testing. If you're testing as you go, when you finish each component, they should already work. ```
