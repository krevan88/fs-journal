# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I am still struggling with positioning items and figuring out how to make certain elements. In class, I can see what the instructor is trying to do when they are writing the example code, however when I sit down and try to do it myself, I feel like a wall has popped up between my brain and fingers and I don't know what I am doing. At this point in the course I am feeling a little bit overwhelmed. However I feel it's a normal overwhelmed. I know that I know what is going on, but again when I have to do it myself I feel a wall. I don't feel like I am drowning yet. Just hoping that this clicks for me soon.
