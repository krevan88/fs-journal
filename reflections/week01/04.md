## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?
   > WF gives the developer a point of reference to look at and build off of. Keeps the developer focused on the overall project instead of skipping around and changing details.
2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
   > Low Fidelity: Smaller, less detailed quick sketches that serve as a starting point.

> Medium Fidelity: Most commonly used. More accurate representations of the layout that is wanted.

> High Fidelity: May include actual featured images, relevant written content. Essentially an exact representation of the end product. 3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
> I think wireframes are worth the time depending on what the project is. If it's a small personal site that you are doing in your spare time. Make a LF wireframe, and go from there. Play around with different things. If there is a customer or it's being done for a business, a MF or HF frame might be needed to get more of the point across.
