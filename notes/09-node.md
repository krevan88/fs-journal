# MVC

Controller first (use other controllers to build what you're working on)


## MongoDB
Connection string goes in .env file.
mongodb+srv://krevan88:<password>@cluster0.my638.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
<password> needs to remove the <> for password to work.
myFirstDatabase should be the name of DB unless DB isnt named

## Auth0
Strings into the .env file for authentication
Application>Domain => AUTH_DOMAIN
Application>ClientID => AUTH_CLIENT_ID
APIs>Audience => AUTH_AUDIENCE
