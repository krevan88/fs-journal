# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern

**1.** What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
```
**2.** How would you access the `name` of the below object using the `property` variable?
```js
let staff = {
  name: "Tim",
  age: 26,
  job: "Code Monkey"
  }
let property = 'name'
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
let property = staff[name]
```
**3.** What is Encapsulation?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The bundling of data, and the methods that act on that data, such that access to that data is restricted from outside the bundle
```
**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Single responsibility principle
```
**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A class is the guide to an object. An instance of a class is using that class to actually create an object.
```
**6.** What is a `Proxy` object?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A proxy object enables you to create a proxy which can redefine operations for another object.
```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Restricts files to doing only one task, which allows your code to be more easily readable.
```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Receives requests from the View, passes that request and data to the Model, then returns the data back to the View.
```
**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Stores states, variables and links.
```
**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Model is the blueprint to the object and is specific to that one object.
```
